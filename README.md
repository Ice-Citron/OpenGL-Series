# OpenGL-Series
This is my repository, to track down, and record everything that I have done, from following Cherno's 31 video OpenGL series. The goal is to deepen my understanding in the OpenGL specification, before I move forward towards finishing my Hazel engine for my CAS project.

In the folder "README - Notes" will contain my notes regarding OpenGL, so that I can refer back to them in the future.
